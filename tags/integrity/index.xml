      <description>Recently I spent some time thinking about rowhammer and integrity issues in general. So, when a colleague asked about software-based mitigations to detect errors on faulty hardware, mainly in the context of CPUs in outer space suffering from cosmic rays corruption, it got me thinking.
I was aware that spaceships usually employ&amp;ndash;very expensive&amp;ndash;hardened CPUs, with special materials, shielding, and redundancy (both spatial, i.e., add resoures, and temporal, i.e., repeat computations). For instance, Perseverance, the recently arrived to Mars rover, runs on a RAD750 PowerPC CPU that costs ~$300,000; or critical systems (like plains or rockets) also tend to duplicate (or triplicate) resources and rely on some majority vote mechanism.</description>
