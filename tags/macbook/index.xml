      <description>This is the first entry in this blog. I&amp;rsquo;m still trying to setup and understand Hugo, but since I&amp;rsquo;m here I guess I should share at least some tip.
I&amp;rsquo;m also setting up the new Macbook Air, and it seems that you need to manually specify whether to run an app with Rosetta (the x86_64 to arm64 translator) or not. As I&amp;rsquo;m going to be using both things, I duplicated the Terminal app, changed its name and icon (I had to do something silly with sips and iconutil), and set one with the option (go to Finder -&amp;gt; Applications -&amp;gt; Utilities, right click and Get Info, and set &amp;ldquo;Open using Rosetta&amp;rdquo;).</description>
